If you want love, we gon' make it

Just don't let me go
Swear you'll keep me close
When I'm flying to the westside
When I catch another redeye
Just don't let me go
Swear you'll keep me close
When I'm flying to the westside
When I catch another redeye
You need to weigh your options
All you do is talk about
The dream or what you call it
Is it everything you wanted?
Is it big enough for the two of us?
What's a couple more, maybe two of us?
Am I big enough for the two of us?
Is it room enough, is it room еnough?
But I can't stop time, I tried to
It just goes past and I can't seem to catch it
No, I can't seem, no, I can't
And I can't slow down, I triеd to
I move too fast and I just end up crashin'
Na, na, na, na
Just don't let me go
Swear you'll keep me close
When I'm flying to the westside
When I catch another redeye
Just don't let me go
Swear you'll keep me close
When I'm flying to the westside
When I catch another redeye (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
So where the fuck you been?
And where you think you goin'?
Is leaving you a sin or not?
Am I better never knowing?
Where the fuck is home? Where the fuck I'm goin'?
Where the fuck my friends? Fuck I'm waiting for?
Think it's time to go, think it's time to call you
Think it's time to go, think it's time to call you
But I can't stop time, I tried to
It just goes past and I can't seem to catch it
No, I can't seem, no, I can't
And I can't slow down, I tried to
I move too fast and I just end up crashin'
Na, na, na, na
Just don't let me go
Swear you'll keep me close
When I'm flying to the westside
When I catch another redeye
Just don't let me go
Swear you'll keep me close
When I'm flying to the westside
When I catch another redeye

If you want me, say you want me
Treadin' softly, on my body while you tell me
That you’re takin' it slow, but you’re pullin' me close
If I bow to the throne, is it better than us?
Give me comfort, give me warnin'
When I wake, you’rе always missin' in the mornin'
But you don’t need to run, if you’re looking for love
Said it’s only a touch, is it bеtter than us to you?

Hmm, hmm, hmm-hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm-hmm
Can’t talk with your tongue in my mouth
I was thinkin' 'bout us when you’re runnin' about
Saw another one’s car at the front of the house
Knew I never meant much, but it’s killin' me now
Mmm, mmm
Tell me all the things I wanna hear, so come here
Beautiful, anyone will do
But you don’t need to run, if you’re looking for love
If it’s only a touch, was it better than us to you?

You decide, you decide it

Never thought that I'd find
That the one in my life would be so near
And now you're here
I got you, you got me
When it's us, babe, you make me feel complete
You're all I need
Ooh, ooh
Maybe we can try it if you let me
Take you by the hand
You're the only one who understands
So I guess that it's time
I asked you to be mine for all my days
I hope you'll stay
I'll admit that I'm scared
It's worth the risk
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Maybe we can try it if you let me
Take you by the hand
You're the only one who understands

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
I just been goin' through motions, back and forth like a ocean
I am a fraud, I am the shit, hoping that nobody notice
Bang chest in the morning, head down in the night
Drink less if I wanted, strike up with the light
And square up, I’m the mightest
Myself in the fight, hurt twice but I tried it
No advice for this shit, might die for this shit
Do I feel alive, feel alive, feel alive?
Feel more like limbo, hands out my window
Chasin' that sunset, that's more my tempo
Yeah, that’s more my tempo
Ooh, but this is all that I am
I only show you the best of me
The best of me
Looked in my demons and saw myself
Put all my meanin' in someone else
Outta sight, outta mind, don't know where to find it
Don't know where to hide, but I still
Eat good, drink good, feel good, s'all good
Can't hear my head when I'm sat beside ya
Fucked lungs and a liver, good looks in the mirror
Do I feel alive, feel alive, feel alive?
Feel more like limbo, hands out my window
Chasin' that sunset, that’s more my tempo
That’s more my tempo
(keshi) Ooh, but this is all that I am
I only show you the best of me
The best of me
Ooh, tryin' but I’m just a man
Hopin' it won't get the best of me
The best of me
I
Just wanted to believe
That maybe you'd be good to me
I'm just misunderstood, you see
You
Never had a clue
All the days that I spent loving you
Who'm I supposed to give 'em to?
I let you in
Again and again
So tell me, baby
What could I do?
What could I do?
I thought you were an angel
And lost myself when I caught sight of you
I'm
Bidding you farewell
You'd never stand a chance in hell
They've got another clientele
You're
Treadin' at the shore
I bet you've never drowned before
In someone that you'd do it for
I let you in
Again and again
So tell me, baby
What could I do?
What could I do?
I thought you were an angel
And lost myself when I caught sight of you
Wait, hold me
Before you leave
Stay, love me
Or I'll bleed
I don't want you to go
Know that I'll miss you so
Before you leave, come see Gabriel
Lay on me
While he breathes
And he grows strongly
And now I see (Oh, oh, oh)
When it's my time to go
Know that I'll miss you so
Before I leave, I'll see GabrielSee ​keshi Live
Never thought that I'd find
That the one in my life would be so near
And now you're here

Ooh, ooh

Make love when the sunrise
Pillow talk in silence
Like this forever (Forever)
White dress or whatever

We got no interruptions and we both feelin' the vibe
Say I'm not your type, but I know what's on your mind
We can talk about nothin' or we can see what it's like
Don't lie, baby, don't lie
His love never felt right
Switch sides and I'm beside you
If you say it's alright (Don't lie, baby, don't lie)
Way too many heads, need a steady view
Smokin' cigarettes at the rendezvous
Never meant to cross you
But my jaw hit the floor with the one, two
Think I want you
You say this ain't love, but it's still the same love
Make love, anything to sate ya
Don't be shy, you decide
Say, can I make you mine?
Don't lie, baby, don't lie
His love never felt right
Switch sides and I'm beside you
If you say it's alright (If you say it's alright)

Don't lie, baby, don't lie
His love never felt right
Switch sides and I'm beside you
If you say it's alright (Don't lie, baby, don't lie)

One, two, one, two, three
Lend me your ears
Hey, where'd you go?
Could've sworn that you were sleepin' over
Say, I don't know
But I thought that we were starting over
Like we always do
Like we always do
Was I a fool?
To think that we always would
(Yes or no? This is your last chance, no beating around the bush)
Gone, not a trace
And it's almost like it never happened
No, not the same
Guess it hurt me more than I imagined
We always do
Like we always do
Was I a fool?
To think that we always would
Like we always do
Like we always do
Was I a fool?
To think that we always would
Said she want more, I'm not enough
Gettin' low and I think I'm givin' up
Baby, come home, I want us
I want us, said I want us
Said she want more, I'm not enough
Gettin' low and I think I'm givin' up
Baby, come home, I want us
I want us, said I want us
Said I gotta get money, swear I still love you
I don't wanna go, but you know that I have to
Touch road, gotta play shows
Crowd go wild for the shit I wrote
But this shit so-so, lose control
Gotta change up everything I know
Better, run ways when you smell that smoke
Better, hold me when my head gon' blow like
Hasta la vista, dyin' to see ya
In a dream that I had where I sing in arenas
Hasta la vista, dyin' to see ya, baby
It ain't so bad when there's nothin' between us
Said she want more, I'm not enough
Gettin' low and I think I'm givin' up
Baby, come home, I want us
I want us, said I want us
Said she want more, I'm not enough
Gettin' low and I think I'm givin' up
Baby, come home, I want us
I want us, said I want us
Gone so fast, all the bad habits
Not gon' last, better run back, kid
Just so sad, worse than last year
Just might crash, just might crash
Just might
Everybody left except for you and I
She don't want stories and lullabies
She don't understand that it's do or die
Said I can buy it all, but it's all a lie
No trade for the things I lost
No train for the boy that stopped
Run ways into these arms of mine
No trade for the things I lost
No train for the boy that stopped
Run ways into these arms of mine
Said she want more, I'm not enough
Gettin' low and I think I'm givin' up
Baby, come home, I want us (Yeah-eah, yeah, ooh-ooh-ooh)
I want us, said I want us
Said she want more, I'm not enough
(Like hasta la vista)
Gettin' low and I think I'm givin' up (Yeah-yeah-yeah, -eah)
(Dyin' to see ya)
Baby, come home, I want us
(In a dream that I had)
I want us, said I want us
(Where I sing in arenas)
Said she want more, I'm not enough
(Like hasta la vista)
Gettin' low and I think I'm givin' up (Yeah-yeah-yeah, -eah)
(Dyin' to see ya)
Baby, come home, I want us
(In a dream that I had)
I want us, said I want us
All my friends are drunk again
And I'm stumblin' back to bed all by myself
Don't need nobody else
All my friends are drunk again
And I'm stumblin' back to bed all by myself
Don't need nobody else
Smell like smoke, Nuit De L'Homme
It's been a while since we last spoke
So tell me, how's it go?
Still love blues, nothin' new
Careless love, I've had a few
How 'bout you?
All my friends are drunk again
And I'm stumblin' back to bed all by myself
Don't need nobody else
All my friends are drunk again
And I'm stumblin' back to bed all by myself
Don't need nobody else
I never thought when you're gone
I'd find it hard to carry on
And it's probably 'cause
I fell in love way back then
And I think about us when
I think about us when
All my friends are drunk again
And I'm stumblin' back to bed all by myself
I got nobody else
All my friends are drunk again
And I'm stumblin' back to bed all by myself
I got, I got nobody else
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, no-no
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Baby, I
Can't decide, I
Need your guidance, ooh
Ooh, ooh

When I fall, I turn to you
And the world just got confusin'
And I think you need me too
You want a night out, fucked up, don't know where to find ya
Drive so fast and we runnin' red lights—igh—igh
Night out, fucked up, don't know where to find ya
Shit won't last, but I wanna make right
So can we talk for a minute, talk for a minute?

Oh my God, I'll give you anything you want

Way too many friends gettin' close on yo'—
Got me runnin' 'round town, I surrender all of me
(Got nobody left to lose)
Oh my God, I'll give you anything you want

Tell me now
Is that the sound
Of all that we were building
Crashin' down
All around us and we never saw it comin'?
Maybe we never make it through
Say that you give another you
Well I won't take it
Or maybe I will
If I had to guess, I think it's you
So if I fake it
Would it be true?
Maybe we've been
A little too caught up
In things that don’t matter
As much as we thought
Maybe we've been
A little too guarded
From things that have hurt us
A bit more than we thought
Nothing more
Than love and war
But no onе knows the differencе
All or none
Call to tell me that I'm not the one you wanted
Maybe we never make it through
Say that you give another you
Well I won’t take it
Maybe I will
If I had to guess, I think it's you
So if I fake it
Would it be true?
Maybe we've been
A little too caught up
In things that don’t matter
As much as we thought
Maybe we've been
A little too guarded
From things that have hurt us
A bit more than we thought
Ups and downs
Goin' steady when you're not around
Go figure
Tell me now
Was that the sound of us?
Said she want more, I'm not enough
Gettin' low and I think I'm givin' up
Baby, come home, I want us
I want us, said I want us
Said she want more, I'm not enough
Gettin' low and I think I'm givin' up
Baby, come home, I want us
I want us, said I want us
Said I gotta get money, swear I still love you
I don't wanna go, but you know that I have to
Touch road, gotta play shows
Crowd go wild for the shit I wrote
But this shit so-so, lose control
Gotta change up everything I know
Better, run ways when you smell that smoke
Better, hold me when my head gon' blow like
Hasta la vista, dyin' to see ya
In a dream that I had where I sing in arenas
Hasta la vista, dyin' to see ya, baby
It ain't so bad when there's nothin' between us
Said she want more, I'm not enough
Gettin' low and I think I'm givin' up
Baby, come home, I want us
I want us, said I want us
Said she want more, I'm not enough
Gettin' low and I think I'm givin' up
Baby, come home, I want us
I want us, said I want us
Gone so fast, all the bad habits
Not gon' last, better run back, kid
Just so sad, worse than last year
Just might crash, just might crash
Just might
Everybody left except for you and I
She don't want stories and lullabies
She don't understand that it's do or die
Said I can buy it all, but it's all a lie
No trade for the things I lost
No train for the boy that stopped
Run ways into these arms of mine
No trade for the things I lost
No train for the boy that stopped
Run ways into these arms of mine
Said she want more, I'm not enough
Gettin' low and I think I'm givin' up
Baby, come home, I want us (Yeah-eah, yeah, ooh-ooh-ooh)
I want us, said I want us
Said she want more, I'm not enough
(Like hasta la vista)
Gettin' low and I think I'm givin' up (Yeah-yeah-yeah, -eah)
(Dyin' to see ya)
Baby, come home, I want us
(In a dream that I had)
I want us, said I want us
(Where I sing in arenas)
Said she want more, I'm not enough
(Like hasta la vista)
Gettin' low and I think I'm givin' up (Yeah-yeah-yeah, -eah)
(Dyin' to see ya)
Baby, come home, I want us
(In a dream that I had)
I want us, said I want us
Ooh
Ooh, da-da-da-da-da
Ooh
Hello, you awake right now?
God, I just need to hear the sound of you
Please calm me down
And I know that it's selfish, but
You are the only thing that's
Ever made sense to me, I
I don't wanna do this
I don't know how to do this without you
Cling to your side, voices at night
Cover my eyes, I'm terrified
No in between, a face on a screen
Ain't an adequate replacement for your being with me (Yeah-yeah)
Too much time in the limelight
Gimme your all on the landline
Want it so bad, but I won't lie
And it just gets worse in the nighttime
Never stays for long (Ooh, da-da-da-da-da)
And she's gone in the morning (Ooh)
When you come home
I just got over bein' less of you
When you leave me, I'm in pieces
Maybe it's better if we cut it loose
Tell me how your day was
No, I'm not okay
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Time never moved so slow
Bed time, hit your phone up
Tell me where to go, where to go
Tell me where to go, where to go-oh-oh
Too much time in the limelight
Gimme your all on the landline
Want it so bad, but I won't lie
And it just gets worse in the nighttime
Never stays for long (Ooh, da-da-da-da-da)
And she's gone in the morning (Ooh)
When you come home
I just got over bein' less of you
When you leave me, I'm in pieces
Maybe it's better if we cut it loose
I don't know how to do this without you
I don't know, I don't know, don't know
I don't know how to do this without you
I don't know, I don't know, don't know
I don't know how to do this without you
Ooh
Ooh, da-da-da-da-da
Ooh
Said I'm alright
Said I'm alright
Sa-said I'm alright, -right, -right
Said I'm alright
Said I'm alright
Sa-said I'm alright, -right, -right
Remember when we sayin' all the same shit
Wish upon the stars that we made it
Got too scared and didn't go
Want so bad, I went alone
Pray so hard for the make up
All the time spent couldn't save us
Got too scared and didn't go
Want so bad, I went alone
Said I'm alright
Said I'm alright
Sa-said I'm alright, -right, -right
Said I'm alright (Ayy!)
Said I'm alright
Sa-said I'm alright, -right, -right
With or without you, I waited my whole life
I could wait a little longer
With or without you, I say that I'm alright
We just grew apart for the same things
But I know we both want the same things
You don't wanna deal with the same things
I don't wanna leave for the same things
(For the same old things)
Said I'm alright
Said I'm alright
Sa-said I'm alright, -right, -right
Said I'm alright (Ayy!)
Said I'm alright
Sa-said I'm alright, -right, -right
And if I was to blame
I swear that I'll pick up the pieces
You say that you don't wanna keep 'em
I'll leave one behind just in case
Through all the mistakes
I'm scared of the fact that you're leavin'
I know that we both had our reasons
But I wish that you wanted to stay, yeah
Said I'm alright
Said I'm alright
Sa-said I'm alright, -right, -right (Ohh, yeah)
Said I'm alright (Ohh, yeah)
Said I'm alright
Sa-said I'm alright, -right, -right (Oh-ohh-ohh)
Said I'm alright (Ayy!)
Said I'm alright
Sa-said I'm alright, -right, -right
Said I'm alright
Said I'm alright
Sa-said I'm alright, -right, -right
Impatient, just say it
Still waitin', for another round
New faces, I'm racin'
On foot, but I'll never make it home
Sixth street for the occasion
Can't take all of the changes
Blue moon in different phases
Blue moon in different places
Three hours, three months away
Go back but not the same
I don't want you to see me
Why was everyone leaving?
Do we say what we mean?
Got the 9-5 and the bloodline
Better dress up for the date night
For the date night
Don't hit my cell
There's an unknown number on my phone
I don't need your help
Just let me lay down on the floor
I don't know myself
Not like the time I did before
No, no
Impatient, just say it
Still waitin' for another round
New faces, I'm racin'
On foot, but I'll never make it home
Sixth street for the occasion
Can't take all of the changes
Blue moon in different phases
Blue moon in different places
Tear me to pieces
I won't even feel it
You're not what I needed
Move on with the seasons
Impatient, just say it
Still waitin' for another round
New faces, I'm racin'
On foot, but I'll never make it home
Sixth street for the occasion
Can't take all of the changes
Blue moon in different phases
Blue moon in different places
I think some words are overdue
Could we just do it over?
Can we just talk it out like friends?
Because I need your shoulder
I know we ended on the wrong terms
But I said we're past it
So why you textin' me with questions
You don't gotta ask me? Like (Hey)
Do you remember 'bout this band you said you listened to?
When we were younger, when we were softer
When we were all about each other
Hope life is treating you better, better, better"
Girl, what's with that?
Yo, cut the act
No, I do not want the past
But if you are ever in need
And God has you down on your knees
And you do not know who to be
Then go on and come home to me
Because I'm here (Ooh-woah)
If you need me, I'll be here (Ooh-woah)
Right here (Ooh-woah)
Said I'm here (Ooh-woah)
If you need me, I'll be here (Ooh-woah)
Right here (Ooh-woah)
Oh
And how you likin' this new guy?
I know you always want the new life
I hope you takin' care of you like
The way you cared for me in my time (Hey)
See you got yourself some new friends
No, you don't need to go to Houston
You got me thinkin' back about then
Girl, I wonder why you textin'
Girl, what's with that?
Yo, cut the act
No, I do not want the past
But if you are ever in need
And God has you down on your knees
And you do not know who to be
Then go on and come home to me
Because I'm here (Ooh-woah)
If you need me, I'll be here (Ooh-woah)
Right here (Ooh-woah)
Said I'm here (Ooh-woah)
If you need me, I'll be here (Ooh-woah)
Right here (Ooh-woah)
Oh
You should have told me
I don't know what to say
Why are you sorry?
How did it get this way?
My heart is broken
Down to my core
It's not what I wanted
I don't know what I want anymore
I'm afraid that band-aids
Are no good for heartache
Not okay, so tell me
When your world is fallin' down
Afraid of fallin' down
But fire has started right behind me
And if I don't jump now
I fear that I can't take the burning
I can't hear a sound
Nothin' that I say can hurt me
Dive into the ground
I fear that I can't take the burning
I'm afraid that band-aids (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ahh)
Are no good for heartache (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ahh)
Not okay, so tell me (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ahh)
When your world is fallin' down (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ahh)
Friends of flowers
Fragile silence
Stand beside you
Stop your cryin'
I'm afraid that band-aids (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ahh)
(Friends of flowers)
Are no good for heartache (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ahh)
(Fragile silence)
Not okay, so tell me (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ahh)
(Stand beside you)
When your world is fallin' down (Ah-ahh, ah-ahh, ah-ahh)
(Stop your cryin')
I can't take it
Tired, I'm fallin' to my knees
I'm weighted
Carry me home like you used to
When I burn my organs, pour the Bourbon
Bear my burdens for the moment
Can I get some help? That's a hell no
But I bet she'd break her neck for that cell phone
Atlas shrugged his shoulders
Said he'd drop that boulder
Call me in the morning when I'm sober
Find me in the corner in a coma
Bottoms up, never stop
I don't think we had enough
Out of touch, maybe I don't give a fuck
Probably not, yeah, I think I'm fallin' off
Fallin' off, yeah
I don't belong here, let me start over
I wanna sleep so wake me up when I'm older
Do not disturb, lost when I'm dreaming
Kick to the curb, all my angels and demons
Guess I'm a little bit scared of the things that I don't understand
Finding semblance of comfort that nothin' will go like I planned (Yeah)
Atlas shrugged his shoulder
Said he'd drop that boulder
Call me in the morning when I'm sober
Find me in the corner in a coma
Bottoms up, never stop
I don't think we had enough
Out of touch, maybe I don't give a fuck
Probably not, yeah, I think I'm fallin' off
Fallin' off, yeah
Bottoms up, never stop
I don't think we had enough
Out of touch, maybe I don't give a fuck
Probably not, yeah, I think I'm fallin' off
Fallin' off, yeah
Stressed out
Feelin' lost and I don't know what to do now
What I chose ain't really gonna work out
Fallin' six feet underneath the floor now
Think I'm gonna tap out (Ooh-ahh, ooh-ahh)
Feel bad, go to bed
Wake up even worse, yeah
So sad, in my head
Feelin' like a curse
I need medicine, medicine, medicine
All my skeletons out for the taking (Ooh-ahh)
Yeah, I don't even know if I'ma make it
I'm afraid of myself and I hate it (Ooh-ahh)
All my skeletons out for the taking
Somebody take 'em
I wanna run away
The day to day is taking its toll on me
And I'm tearin' at the seams (Ooh-ahh)
Throw it all away
Give a fuck about what they say
I gotta disagree
This ain't really fun for me
Feel bad, go to bed
Wake up even worse, yeah
So sad, in my head
Feelin' like a curse
I need medicine, medicine, medicine
All my skeletons out for the taking (Ooh-ahh)
Yeah, I don't even know if I'ma make it
I'm afraid of myself and I hate it (Ooh-ahh)
All my skeletons out for the taking
Somebody take 'em
Feel like summer and I don't wanna miss you
If we don’t touch lips, not an issue
I don’t wanna talk 'bout nobody else
Know I said no love but I want to
Feel like summer and I don't wanna miss you
If we don’t touch lips, not an issue
I don’t wanna talk 'bout nobody else
Know I said no love but I want to
One time, maybe twice in
One night, it’s alright we’re
Both alone so go together
Kiss my wounds but not forever
Fuck around, feel my heartbeat
Fallin' down in the backseat
Fill me up 'cause I'm runnin' on empty
And it’s fine if we’re only pretending
Three months is all we got
Try not to fall in love
Don’t think I've had enough but I said it’s fine by me
Feel like summer and I don't wanna miss you
If we don’t touch lips, not an issue
I don’t wanna talk 'bout nobody else
Know I said no love but I want to
Feel like summer and I don't wanna miss you
If we don’t touch lips, not an issue
I don’t wanna talk 'bout nobody else
Know I said no love but I want to
Said we goin' bye bye in a minute
I'ma chill on the Southside, caught feelings
When the leaves turn, no more favors
Nice to meet ya, catch you later, yeah
Three months is all we got
Try not to fall in love
Said I ain’t had enough but I think that’s fine by me
Feel like summer and I don't wanna miss you
If we don’t touch lips, not an issue
I don’t wanna talk 'bout nobody else
Know I said no love but I want to
Feel like summer and I don't wanna miss you
If we don’t touch lips, not an issue
I don’t wanna talk 'bout nobody else
Know I said no love but I want to
(Kiss my wounds but not forever
Fill me up 'cause I'm runnin' on empty
Kiss my wounds but not forever
And it’s fine if we’re only pretending)

I'm fallin' in deeper
She’s callin' my keeper
I wanted the reaper
Will end it, just let me go
No
But something brings me back to you
She wouldn't tell me why
It's time to say goodbye
What did you do, what did you do?
Baby, just tell me lies
We runnin' out of time (Yuh)
Say that she can't decide (No)
It's up to you, it's up to you
We gonna live or die?
Lay me to rest in peace, yuh
Don't want your honesty, yuh
I wanna see you when
You're lying right here next to me
She don't want me, but I burn inside
She don't wanna keep this heart of mine
She don't wanna leave just one time
But when I fall asleep, give me cyanide
I'm fallin' in deeper
She’s callin' my keeper
I wanted the reaper
Will end it, just let me go
No
But something brings me back to you
Love me, let me know
Stay or should I go?
Know that she was never mine to hold
Reaping what I sow
Taking what I owe
When she come to take another soul
I'm fallin' in deeper
She’s callin' my keeper
I wanted the reaper
Will end it, just let me go
No
But something brings me back to you
I'm fallin' in deeper
She’s callin' my keeper
I wanted the reaper
Will end it, just let me go
No
But something brings me back to you
Baby, I call in the dead of night
But you don't need me like I need you
Pray that I won't be alone
Baby, I call in the dead of night
But you don't need me like I need you
Pray that I won't be alone
Layin' on the bed waitin' for your text (Be alone)
Babe, there's nothin' left
Faded, I'm a wreck (Be alone)
Afraid what's comin' next
Wished we never met (Be alone)
Layin' us to rest but baby, I beg you (Be alone)
Too soon with a drunk call
In the middle of the night
You took it, my fault (Be alone)
Didn't really mean to interrupt (Be alone)
But if you change your mind, then hit me up (Be alone)
Pain, that's an option
No time for nonsense
Can't ask you nothing
Drank, feeling nauseous
Too many toxins, not even conscious
Say nothin' more, say nothin' more, baby
Pain, that's an option
No time for nonsense
Can't ask you nothing
Drank, feeling nauseous
Too many toxins, not even conscious
Say nothin' more, say nothin' more, baby
We're better on our own
Tonight, I'm gettin' throwed (You don't need me)
She never comin' home
Stay with me (Pray that I won't be alone)
Say you'll leave (You don't need me)
(Be alone, yeah-eah-eah-eah)
Pain, that's an option
No time for nonsense

Drank, feeling nauseous
Too many toxins, not even conscious

Too many toxins, not even conscious
Say nothin' more, say nothin' more, baby
Baby girl is sayin' that we just friends
That we just friends, uh
If we fuckin', are we just friends?
Are we just friends? No
Drank too much, got the sickness
Pray to God and his son for forgiveness
Same crew but another mistress
Every day, every night getting wasted
But I miss you, what did I do?
Fuck it up, laugh it off and I lost you
If I pull through, is it too soon?
Turn it up, close my eyes and I'm with you
Yo, Marvin, stop calling
Sad Iverson is ballin'
In the corner of a room by himself
You are nothin' but an empty shell
Every night, he goin' down to hell
Fake love in a shit hotel
Can't believe how far he fell
You weak on the floor, so you call her cell
You been good? I been drinking
Way too much, you'd think that I'd be over you
Over you, over you"
(Eight calls, all you)
But I think about it every day, yeah
Yeah, I never missed her anyways
Yeah, I never missed her anyways (Yeah-eah-eah)
Drank too much, got the sickness
Pray to God and his son for forgiveness
Same crew but another mistress
Every day, every night getting wasted
But I miss you, what did I do?
Fuck it up, laugh it off and I lost you
If I pull through, is it too soon?
Turn it up, close my eyes and I'm with you
Call me up
Stay over and we'll call it love
Don't matter if it fucks me up
The alcohol is not enough (Ooh, yeah)
Fuck pride and the other guy
I cried, I don't 'member why
Tonight, I'ma try to hide
No slide, get frostbite
Eight calls, all you, 8 ball, all you
Yeah, I never missed her anyways
Yeah, I never missed her anyways
Drank too much, got the sickness
Pray to God and his son for forgiveness (Yeah-eah-eah-eah-yeah)
Same crew but another mistress
Every day, every night getting wasted (Ooh-ohh, ooh)
But I miss you, what did I do?
Fuck it up, laugh it off and I lost you (Yeah-eah)
If I pull through, is it too soon?
Turn it up, close my eyes and I'm with you (Yeah-eah-eah)
Drank too much, got the sickness
Pray to God and his son for forgiveness
Same crew but another mistress
Every day, every night getting wasted (Yeah, yeah, yeah, too)
But I miss you, what did I do?
Fuck it up, laugh it off and I lost you (Hea-hea-hea)
If I pull through, is it too soon?
Turn it up, close my eyes and I'm with you
(I swear I'll never leave again)
Mirror on the wall, can you tell me who I am?
I think that I forgot, so remind me once again
Maybe I was going too fast
Babe, I’d give it all to go back (Yeah-ea-eah)
Baby, I'm better, I promise
Know that I've never been honest
Maybe I never forgot it (Forgot it)
Daily reminder, tattoos of tigers
Cigarette lighters, laughter and cider
(Daily reminder, tattoos of tigers
Cigarette lighters, laughter and cider)
Ohh (Ohh)
Ohh (Yeah)
(Yeah-yeah-yeah)
I don't deserve this, all in your arms
All your forgiveness, I don't belong
I swear, I swear I'll never leave again
(Daily reminder, tattoos of tigers
Cigarette lighters, laughter and cider
Maybe I was going too fast
Babe, I’d give it all to go back)
So this is love?
Just hold me close, I’ll never leave
I won’t let go
Ohh, I swear I'll never leave again
Drank too much, got the sickness
Pray to God and his son for forgiveness
Same crew but another mistress
Every day, every night getting wasted
But I miss you, what did I do?
Fuck it up, laugh it off and I lost you
If I pull through, is it too soon?
Turn it up, close my eyes and I'm with you
Yo, Marvin, stop calling
Sad Iverson is ballin'
In the corner of a room by himself
You are nothin' but an empty shell
Every night, he goin' down to hell
Fake love in a shit hotel
Can't believe how far he fell
You weak on the floor, so you call her cell
You been good? I been drinking
Way too much, you'd think that I'd be over you
Over you, over you"
(Eight calls, all you)
But I think about it every day, yeah
Yeah, I never missed her anyways
Yeah, I never missed her anyways (Yeah-eah-eah)
Drank too much, got the sickness
Pray to God and his son for forgiveness
Same crew but another mistress
Every day, every night getting wasted
But I miss you, what did I do?
Fuck it up, laugh it off and I lost you
If I pull through, is it too soon?
Turn it up, close my eyes and I'm with you
Call me up
Stay over and we'll call it love
Don't matter if it fucks me up
The alcohol is not enough (Ooh, yeah)
Fuck pride and the other guy
I cried, I don't 'member why
Tonight, I'ma try to hide

I'm lost and, I'm lost and
We lost in, emotion
I'm sorry, unspoken
Stop talking, explosion
Make up sex, so broken
Don't leave me, don't leave me
I know you, you need me
I know I'm not that easy, but babe, I'm on my knees
So lost that we can't see
I want you next to me
You wanna see me bleed
You wanna hear me scream
So loud, but no sound
We fall down, we fall down
On and off, and off and on
Can we talk, what's goin' on?
When we stop, we never stop
It's every day, every day (Yeah)
On and off, and off and on
Can we talk, what's goin' on?
When we stop, we never stop
It's every day, every day (Yeah)
Careful, slowly, darling, what's the hurry?
Love me, hate me, kiss me when you hurt me
Dancin' when we're burning
Every day, she learning
Ways to cut my heart into the shape she wants to turn me
Baby, that's a no-no
How low can you go, go?
Stick around to find how bad she'll wreck my fuckin' heart though
So loud, but no sound
We fall down, we fall down
On and off, and off and on
Can we talk, what's goin' on? (Hey!)
When we stop, we never stop
It's every day, every day (Yeah)
On and off, and off and on
Can we talk, what's goin' on?
When we stop, we never stop
It's every day, every day (Yeah)
Take me to the good days
And my old ways with my old friends
Trade it all away just to spend a day with them
Fuck, I'm on my own shit, I can own it
Fuck, it's lonely, I'm so lonely

Take me to the good days
And my old ways with my old friends
Trade it all away just to spend a day with them

Fuck, I hate this

I get dressed and do my day shift
Wanna end it
God, I hate this, I hate this
I hate this, I hate this
Buy a bunch of shit that I don't need
Room is gettin' full, but I'm empty
God, I'm on my knees, someone save me
Someone save me (Yeah-heah-heah)
Fuck, I feel a way
I don't know what day it is
Please don't go away
Lyin' on the floor
Is there somethin' more to this that I'm livin' for?
Must be somethin' more to this
Take me to the good days
And my old ways with my old friends
Trade it all away just to spend a day with them

Fuck, it's lonely, I'm so lonely

Sex don't help, I hate myself
And I don't feel the same as I used to (As I used to)
So alone inside my home
But I feel kinda better when I'm with you
But it ain't enough, no
Even if it’s love, no
I miss how it was, no
I miss how it was
Fuck, I feel a way
I don't know what day it is
Please don't go away
